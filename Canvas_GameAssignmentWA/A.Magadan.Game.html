  <h1>Anthony Magadan / Stick Hero</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <div id="score"></div>
    <canvas id="game"></canvas>
    <div id="introduction">Hold down the mouse to stretch out a stick</div>
    <div id="perfect">DOUBLE SCORE</div>
    <button id="restart">RESTART</button>
  </div>
  
  <script src="script.js"></script>

  <p>The assignment was pretty easy as most of the elements for the game were kept in a div container which allowed me to just move and resize the container and make the elements fill it. Changing the game colors was also easy as all it took was to search for the parts in the code that drew the objects and change their fill styles. However I struggled with trying to zoom in the game.</p>
